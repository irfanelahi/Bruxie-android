We hope that you’ll it helpful in getting more out of life, treats and all!\n\nTo participate in the LIFE Challenge:\nEach week you can complete up to 7 challenges customized for you by Zoës. Simply tap on the Life Goals tab and you’ll be prompted to choose up to 3 goal areas. A week’s worth of challenges will be determined by your selected goal areas and will refresh every Sunday with a new set of challenges. Do as many as you can, but don’t worry if you can’t complete them all – we know your life is busy!\n\nAfter you’ve performed one of your weekly challenges, mark it as complete by tapping on the check box next to it. You’ll see your cup of Limeade fill a bit and once the cup is full you’re eligible for a Goodie from Zoës!\nYou can change your Goal Areas at any time by scrolling to the bottom of your weekly challenge list.</string> -->
    <string name="FAQQ1">How does this work?</string>
    <string name="FAQQ2">How do I know how many points I have?</string>
    <string name="FAQA2">Tap the Love tab on the navigation bar. There you can track how many points you have and how far away you are from being able to redeem the <i>Love</i>. Green-colored rewards are ready to be redeemed. Light green-colored rewards are ones you are still working towards earning – when you have enough points to redeem one of these rewards, it will turn green.</string>
    <string name="FAQQ3">How do I redeem the <i>Love</i>?</string>
    <string name="FAQA3">In the Love tab, tap on any Green-colored reward that you want to redeem and it will instantly turn into a digital reward that you can present to the cashier at check-out. Click on “Redeem the <i>Love</i>” when you are in line to order, and then “Confirm” when you are IN FRONT OF THE CASHIER. You will have a couple minutes to show the cashier your unique code.</string>
    <string name="FAQQ4">How do I use my digital voucher?</string>
    <string name="FAQA4">Just tap the blue Redeem reward button that appears after you’ve selected the reward you’d like to redeem.  Show your phone to the cashier.  Once you have redeemed your reward you cannot redeem it again until you have accumulated enough points to do so. You’ll need to be connected to your mobile network in order for the voucher to successfully be redeemed.</string>
    <string name="FAQQ5">I\'m having trouble uploading my receipt from the app. What do I do?</string>
    <string name="FAQA5">Email the image receipt to us along with your account email address (the one you use for log in) to CornerBakery@rlvt.net.</string>
    <string name="FAQQ6">Can I make some suggestions?</string>
    <string name="FAQA6">Sure! We\'d be happy to hear from you at CornerBakery@rlvt.net.</string>
